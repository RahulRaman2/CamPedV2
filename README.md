CamPedV2 a real-world pedestrian detection dataset specifically designed to address the challenges posed by adverse weather conditions, occlusion, and visual ambiguity caused by person like objects.
It is the expansion of CamPed Dataset. The dataset contains 114,967 images and 545,590 annotated pedestrian instances.  The enhanced version adds over 13,000 new images captured in real-world foggy (7,906 images, 103,530 instances)
and rainy (5,376 images, 42,060 instances) conditions, improving model resilience in weather-degraded scenarios.
